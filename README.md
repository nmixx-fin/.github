# nmixx-fin

Welcome to **nmixx-fin**, the official GitHub organization for the Financial NLP Lab at ModuLabs. Our mission is to advance the field of natural language processing (NLP) tailored for financial data.

## About Us
At the Financial NLP Lab, we focus on developing state-of-the-art embedding models, benchmarks, and tools specifically designed for financial language tasks. Our work bridges the gap between advanced NLP technologies and the unique challenges posed by financial texts.

## Our Goals
- **Financial Language Embeddings**: Building domain-specific embedding models optimized for financial data.
- **Benchmark Creation**: Developing comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate NLP models on financial tasks.
- **Open Research**: Promoting open collaboration and reproducible research in financial NLP.

## Projects
Here are some of the key projects we're working on:
- **Financial Embedding Models**: Pretrained models designed for financial documents, news, and reports.
- **Financial NLP Benchmarks**: Datasets and evaluation tasks to measure model performance on financial text analysis.
- **Toolkits**: Tools to simplify the use of NLP models for financial data processing.

## Get Involved
We welcome contributions from researchers, developers, and practitioners in the financial and NLP communities. Feel free to explore our repositories, open issues, and contribute to our projects.
